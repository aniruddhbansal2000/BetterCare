# BetterCare
An iOS application used for detecting cardiovascular diseases.

# INTRODUCTION <br>
Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke and possible heart failure among others.Its instance is caused due to buildup of fatty plaques in arteries leading to constriction of path and stiffening of walls inhibiting blood flow and causing pressure on heart and arteries.It is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year.Thus it has become imperative to deal with it and find ways to prevent and cure it.This can be made possible by utilising the vast amount of health data to build a model and make informed decisions and predictions about the possibility of cardiovascular disease in a given person. Therefore Machine Learning can help utilise healthcare data and give breakthrough in early identification and prevention.<br>

# SOLUTION <br>
The following problem can be solved by building a Machine Learning model using supervised learning techniques to perform Binary Classification on user data , by applying different algorithms (like logistic regression , naive bayes , support vector machines , decision trees eic). The assigned data is divided into 2 sets , for training and testing respectively. It is preprocessed , analysed and visualized for training the model. The model is then designed using different algorithms or their combination , trained and tested to determine accuracy.Thus , we develop our model which with a good degree of accuracy can predict incidence of cardiovascular disease in a person.This model can then be integrated into a mobile based application. The application helps create an integrated system which allows the user to enter his details and run the model on his/her characteristics generating prediction result for user. This system contains user interface , model , storage together integrated to create a robust system to generate intended results.<br>
